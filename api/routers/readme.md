Formatting the following routes should be done in this hierarchy to maintain consistency.


1. API or DEV
2. Version Number V(1->9999 etc)
3. Route branch which encompasses a determined grouping (ex. users, trainers, administrators, etc)
4. Sub-topic relevant to that group.

Example: {ROOT}/API/V1/users/request-history | This indicates the request history sub-topic of the users group, on version 1 of the main branch.

Kebab case should be used in all cases, lowercase for everything but API/DEV/V
