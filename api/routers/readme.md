Formatting the following routes should be done in this hierarchy to maintain consistency.


1. Version Number V(1->9999 etc)
2. Route branch which encompasses a determined grouping (ex. users, trainers, administrators, etc)
3. Sub-topic relevant to that group.

Example: {ROOT}/V1/users/request-history | This indicates the request history sub-topic of the users group, on version 1 of the main branch.
